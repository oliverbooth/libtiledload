# libtiledload
This is a Java library that imports XML-style TMX maps created in Tiled.

I wrote it to complement my [university project](https://github.com/oliverbooth/Game-3) which was a 2D key-collecting game.

## Do Not Use This
I highly recommend you forget you ever saw this code because I have not touched it since 2013.

But feel free to fork and learn I guess.
